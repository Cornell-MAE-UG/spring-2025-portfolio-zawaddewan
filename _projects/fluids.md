For MAE 3230, our final project was the "Fluid Mechanical Dissection." In groups of 3-4, we were tasked to disassemble a device making use of fluid mechanics, and create a 5-minute video explaining its operation and how the fluid mechanics we learned in class came into play. Our device was a weed wacker, powered by a two-stroke engine. The primary component of fluid mechanical-interest is the carburetor, a device within the engine responsible for mixing air and fuel for combustion within the piston cylinder. Our video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZLGq0wO1b0)

My contributions to the dissection were as follows:
- Figuring out what calculations to present and how to motivate them
- Helping with the final layout order of info for slides/video
- Participating in the dissection by helping take apart most of the engine
- Editing the script
- Voicing the last minute of the video
