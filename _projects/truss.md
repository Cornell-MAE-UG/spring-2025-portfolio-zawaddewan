To learn more about trusses and because I was tired of solving them for statics, I made my own truss code. This was also written in Golang. It can take an input file defining nodes, loads, and elements and perform a first order linear static analysis of the desired truss structure. The methods used to develop this program come from the textbook Matrix Structural Analysis, by McGuire, Gallagher, and Ziemian.

Here's an example output from the program:

![Truss Output]({{ "/assets/images/box.png" | relative_url }}){: .inline-image-r style="width: 200px"}
